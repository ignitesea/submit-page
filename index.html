    <h2>Submit a Talk to Ignite Seattle</h2>
    <p>We're excited to see your pitch! It's ok if you're new to public speaking: accepted speakers receive free
       individual coaching.</p>
    <p>We won't ask you for slides with your submission, but keep in mind the final talk will need to be 5 minutes,
      with 20 slides that auto-advance every 15 seconds.</p>
    <p>Don't submit a talk focused on pitching your organization, or self-help/life advice.
       To improve your chances, <a href="https://igniteseattle.com/2013/07/08/how-to-get-your-talk-accepted/" target="_blank">read our insider advice.</a></p>
